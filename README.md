# Customer-Management-System



<h1> Customer Management System </h1>



<pre>
CMSusingOOPs:-  In this I have created a python program which is used to get the details of the customers, Add customer, Delete Customer and many more things using pickle
                to put the saved data into a folder created inside the storage system of your device. Please change the name folder or add the folder to your device storage
                before you run this program in your device.



   CMSGUI   :- In this program I have created a GUI(Graphic User Interface) for the CMSusingOOPs. Before running this program please run the CMSusingOOPs otherwise it will 
               show error.
